# Mathematica Code and Project Euler Solutions

* Project Euler solutions are located in the folder [euler](https://github.com/konaseema/mmacode/tree/master/euler)
* This folder contains miscellaneous mathematica code written for various purposes
* Some of these files may or may not work with your version of Mathematica
* I take no responsibility for the correctness or any liability of any code posted in this repository

# Project Euler Solutions

* The solutions in general need to be optimized
* My convention is to use as much of the Mathematica-style functional programming as possible
* Pull requests will be reviewed promptly. Please use RepeatedTiming or some other justification for code merges
* The more obtuse and hard to read your code is, the more likely I am to approve it.
